      <h4 class="text-black fs-20 mb-20 block">1. Check-In, tear down and evaluate.</h4>
      <p class="lead">Before any restoration work begins we document the entire vehicle with photographs and notations. These photos are then uploaded to a customers internet web page. 
        We do a thorough inspection of the frame and all the sheet metal. We look at each of the panels gaps and how they line up with the adjacent panels.
        We also look for any prior damage from rust or a collision and inspect for prior repairs, parts that have been changed and document any alterations that have been done to the vehicle.
        Before disassembly, damaged panels or panels that appear to fit poorly are addressed. We first work to get all of the gaps aligned and each panel properly shimmed.
        We then completely disassemble the vehicle down to the frame. During disassembly, documentation continues and salvageable parts are itemized and inventoried. </p>
      <p class="lead">All body parts are stripped of the paint, fillers and rust corrosion. We media blast the body and chassis, sometimes we will chemically strip a panel, other times we will sand to strip. If panels are not salvageable we will fabricate one if replacement panels are not available from any of our trusted sources. We also check that each panel has good structural integrity and will endure the test of time.</p>

      <h4 class="text-black fs-20 mb-20 block">2. Body and Refinishing.</h4>
      <img src="assets/img/logo/3D_logo_build/small_text_white.fw.png" class="float-right" alt=""/>
      <p class="lead"> After we have stripped the vehicle down we cover all bare metal with two coats of an epoxy primer. we then perform any panel replacement that is needed as well as the metal repairs, we also correct any frame and structural damage.</p>
      <p class="lead"> We then begin a detailed process of filling, sanding, leveling, priming, and then finally applying a PPG basecoat/clearcoat finish. There are dozens of steps that the paint shop goes through to make sure the body appearance is perfect. including a vigorous clear coat leveling and final buffing and polishing stage.</p></div>
			
			<div class="shadow p-20 mt-100 bg-white">
      <h4 class="text-black fs-20 mb-20 block">3. Chassis, Suspension and Steering</h4>
      <p class="lead">chassis components are completely disassembled, cleaned, inspected and reassembled with new OEM parts when available. Upgrades to steering and suspension can also be done to provide better feel, performance and reliability. weld in reinforcements and new body to frame mounts are installed as the body is reattached to the frame. care is taken when aligning the body to the frame. to ensure proper parallel alignment. measurements are taken throughout this procedure.</p>
      <p class="lead">steering components gear boxes and power assist pistons are generally rebuildable, modern rack and pinion and electric assist systems are available for some applications. some steering wheels that can not be replaced can be reconstructed with fiberglass resins and epoxy to a near factory original state. ball joints, tie rod ends and steering linkages are best replaced with new components for safety reasons.</p></div>

      <p class="lead">Vehicle chassis harnesses can be replaced if they are available, we can generally fabricate and repair any wiring damage encountered, we often retrofit a modern Painless performance harness or a custom Kwikwire wiring harness. they include updated power relays and a stable mini fuse systems, modern auto-meter custom gauges can be wired in to most cars, alternators and generators are completely rebuilt and tested using new OEM components when available. possible upgrades to the charging system inculde powerful 130A one wire alternator setups. and 6V to 12V conversions. modern high torque starters are available for most engines and are substantially lighter than the original. </p>
      <p class="lead">exterior and interior lighting is returned to the same state as the day the vehicle was manufactured. unless otherwise requested we generally avoid LED upgrades, we prefer to use the old fashioned bulbs and reflectors that reflect the time period. we often get request to 
        install factory or factory-like fog light upgrades, interior footwell interior lighting upgrades, and brighter headlamp options. </p>

      <h4 class="text-black fs-20 mb-20 block">5. Powertrain Components</h4>
      <p class="lead">when performing an engine rebuild, engines are completely disassembled, cleaned, and blocks are magnafluxed for cracks, the magnaflux method is used to find cracks in cylinder heads, engine blocks, connecting rods and crankshafts as well as other components of the engine that can not be seen normally. cylinder heads are pressure tested with adaptors that apply a high pressure air to the casting. which will reveal any hidden small cracks that may not be noticable in the cylinder head otherwise.</p>
      <p class="lead">Engines that can be rebuilt are rebuilt to within factory allowable tolerances, complete OEM rebuild kits are available for most engines, they generally include all new pistons, rings, seals and gaskets, rod and main bearings, and a new high volume oil pump. cylinder heads are rebuilt to factory specifications, with all new guides and seals. valves are either replaced or reground. cylinder heads are corrected for any warpage. and blocks and heads may be milled as necessary.Engines can be rebuilt to original, or replaced to original like,  or upgraded to a modern day powertrain system. coyote, hemi and LS swaps are some options that customers often consider.</p>
      <p class="lead">automatic transmission builds are flow tested and valve bodies and governors are calibrated to factory specifications. manual transmissions are rebuilt  using new synchronizer and bearing kits for a fuller rebuild, rear ends recieve all new bearings and seals, final  drive gearset patterns are checked and corrected as necessary. </p></div><div class="shadow p-20 mt-100 bg-white">
    
      <h4 class="text-black fs-20 mb-20 block">6. Braking and Parking systems</h4>
      <p class="lead">when restoring the braking system to the original factory state we like replace all of the braking hardware available for the vehicle. including all of the rubber flexible brake lines, all reusable drums and rotors are machined uniformly on a brake lathe. and all metal brake lines can be replaced as needed. upgrades to the braking system can vary from a simple factory disc upgrade  to a exotic wilwwood brake setup. parking brake cables generally are always replaced and fabricated from high quality cables. over the years fatigued old cables can suddenly snap.</p></div>
